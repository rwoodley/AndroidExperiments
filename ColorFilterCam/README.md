Simplest code possible to take a picture in Android. And let me tell you, it aint simple.   

To be fair, there is another way to do this using intents which I didn't explore.   

This handles rotation.  I tried to do without the preview screen, but some devices require it. I suppose it could be shrunk to 1px.
