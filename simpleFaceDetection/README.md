This project is based on the face-detection sample included in OpenCV4Android docs.   

However, I simplified it as follows:   
- I only use the Java face detection, so we don't need the NDK.   
- It relies on the openCV .aar file, so you don't need to import the open CV SDK module and clutter up git with all those files.
